Teach AI To Play Snake! Reinforcement Learning With PyTorch and Pygame
In this Python Reinforcement Learning Tutorial series we teach an AI to play Snake! We build everything from scratch using Pygame and PyTorch. The tutorial consists of 4 parts:

You can find all tutorials on my channel: Playlist

Part 1: I'll show you the project and teach you some basics about Reinforcement Learning and Deep Q Learning.
Part 2: Learn how to setup the environment and implement the Snake game.
Part 3: Implement the agent that controls the game.
Part 4: Implement the neural network to predict the moves and train it.

## Installation

1. git clone the project in a folder that you con open with VScode (I recomend)
2.  I recomend using a conda virtual enviroment, and in there install the requirements and run the app.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. And in the terminal of the venv run the app
    ```bash
    python agent.py
    ```
   
## Usage
* Runing agent.py will display two windows one with the plot of the score and de mean score, also how many games it takes  to the agent to reach that score. On another display you will see the snake game

* The agent playing
